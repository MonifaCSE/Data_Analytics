Hello Everyone,

I'm excited to showcase my ‘HR Analytics' project using Power BI.



🛡𝗢𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 - The main objective is to gain valuable insights from data about the people who work for a Company, how to increase their effectiveness through decision-making based on the insights, and what realistic goals may be set for them, and proposes to look at an easy and interactive dashboard for the same.



✍𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 - Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Modeling, Visualization, DAX functions, Page Navigation.



🔍𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀:



🔑Male workers are greater than female.

🔑4.9% of workers did not get a promotion for more than 10 years.

🔑8% of workers need retirement.

🔑 Employees mostly need to be promoted and retired from the Research and Development department.

🔑The performance rating for the Research Director job role is quite good.
